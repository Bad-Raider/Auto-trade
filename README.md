## Discription

Welcome to my project! This is a one-page business card website designed for an entrepreneur specializing in car sourcing services for clients. The website serves as a platform to showcase the entrepreneur's expertise in vehicle selection, provide car reviews, and offer consultations to potential clients.

This project marks a significant milestone for me as it represents my first personal commercial endeavor. In the near future, **I plan to deploy it to a hosting platform** to make it accessible to a wider audience.

## Project Status

The development of this website is an ongoing process. I am continuously working on refining and enhancing its features to ensure a seamless and informative experience for users. Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
